# Multi- and single panel mean wind plots, mean current plots for Black Sea

Sample codes and figures using NCAR language () for plotting mean wind data
from ECMWF ERA5 model for a selected region over the Black Sea. Mean current 
with current speed and direction for the Black Sea model is reproduced for two
seasons.

## Description

In `BlackSeaCMCC2017meanmonthly.ncl` seasonal means are plotted for the Black 
Sea model as in the figure here.

In `BlackSeaData_MultiPanel.ncl` the multi- panel plots are generated for 
the Black Sea for near-to-surface atmospheric wind from ECMWF ERA5.
